This is a file of code that gets commented out and clutters my files, but may be useful later

green.rb, inside InGame.setup:
# Draws a border of Green objects
space = 32
(640/space).times do |x|
	Green.new x*space, 0
end
(640/space).times do |x|
	Green.new x*space, @@screen.height-32
end
(480/space).times do |y|
	Green.new 0, y*space
end
(480/space).times do |y|
	Green.new @@screen.width-32, y*space
end
